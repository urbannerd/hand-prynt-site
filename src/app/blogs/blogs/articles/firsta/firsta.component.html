            <p><b>About Confido Gold:</b><b><br />
            </b><b><br />
            </b>Confido aims to revolutionise ecommerce shipping by providing an easy to use app that allows buyers and sellers to transact seamlessly while also providing a tracking feature. All secured by blockchain technology.</p>
            <p>The app can already be integrated with the following vendors: United States Postal Service,  FedEx, UPS, DHL, Postnl and EMS.<br />
            <b><br />
            </b>Confido works by using smart contracts with a unique shipment tracking feature. When a new transaction is made by a user, Confido will generate a smart contract using a secure smart contract template and the data entered by the user.</p>
            <p>That smart contract will act as the escrow between buyer and seller. Once the funds have been received by the smart contract the seller is prompted to submit a shipment tracking code to the smart contract (which is all done inside the app).</p>
            <p>Our smart contract will continuously track the delivery status of the package and will release the funds 24 hours after the package has been delivered. In case of a wrong or faulty product the buyer can put the transaction on hold.</p>
            <p>They successfully completed their ICO in 40 seconds, $300,000 were collected in this short time. They have clearly become one of the  most successful  ICOs of 2017.</p>
